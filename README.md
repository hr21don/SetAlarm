# SetAlarm
Your goal for this challenge is to write a Python function, which sets an alarm by playing a sound file and print a message at the specified time.
## Input
The function should have three inputs for the time you want to set the alarm to go off, the sound file you want to play, and the message to display.

## Output call
set_alarm(time.time()+1 , 'alarm-audio.wav' , 'wake up Adam!')

for e.g. output  
* import time
* from AlarmClock import set_alarm
* set_alarm(time.time()+1, 'alarm-clock-1', 'WAKE UP NOW!' )
* Alarm set for Wed Oct 20 13:11:07 2021
* WAKE UP NOW!
